# Bayesian-Top-Down-Modelling
This repo contains a number of scripts for top-down population disagregation using the randomForest R package and the bartMachine R package. 
There are four scripts in this repo. The first script BART_Simulation_Workflow.R implement a simulation study using Bayesian random forest disagregation. 
The RF_Simulation_Workflow implement a simulation study using the randomForest R package. Results from the simulaton study from the Bayesian random forest are compared
to the randomforest package to determine the predictive performance of both model. 
We apply both modelling approach to disagregate the 2021 census data of Ghana. The Bayesian approach workflow is called BART_Workflow.R and the random forest workflow is called
Random_Forest_Workflow.R
